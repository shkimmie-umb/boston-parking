# Find Food NYC

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

I created Find Food NYC because I found the official [Get Food NYC Map](https://nyc-oem.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=d781ef8a46cf417dbbfaf28f3b902ac4) could have some features that can help users. For example, I added a filter menu that filters certain markers by type of location and the cost. Also, when a marker is selected there is a link to google maps to that location, so users can have quick access to directions. 
Also, [Get Food NYC Map](https://nyc-oem.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=d781ef8a46cf417dbbfaf28f3b902ac4) did not have a public API, so I used a script that turns Excel .csv file into JSON.

Currently the app:
* Filters markers
* Has a link to Google Map Location

In the future, I want to add:
* Find near me tool
* Fix Bugs
  * Markers are on top of the Filter Menu and Reset Map Button

## Technologies
Find Food NYC uses React, React Map GL, and Mapbox
